    <!-- The text below is an explanation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts -->

    <!-- OOP: Object-Oriented Programming -->

    <!-- object: (Physical Entity) -->
    <!-- An object is a real-world entity that is an instance of a class -->
    <!-- Examples: male, female, cow, cat, dog, car -->

    <!-- class: (Logical Entity) -->
    <!-- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects -->
    <!-- Examples: Human, Animal, Vehicles -->

    <!-- A class encapsulates data members (variables) and member functions (methods) into a single unit -->

    <!-- Security in OOP: -->
    <!-- 1. Class and Object -->
    <!-- A constructor is a special function that is automatically called when an object is created -->
    <!-- There are different types of constructors: default, parameterized, copy -->

    <!-- 2. Encapsulation: The concept of hiding data from the outside world to protect it from unauthorized access -->

    <!-- 3. Abstraction: The concept of exposing only necessary data and hiding the rest -->
    <!-- This allows users to interact with a simplified interface while keeping the implementation details hidden -->

    <!-- 4. Inheritance: The concept of creating new classes from existing ones to promote code reusability -->

    <!-- 5. Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different data types -->
    <!-- Polymorphism allows methods to be used interchangeably across different classes -->
    <!-- Example: 
         - 4 + 5 = 9 (Addition)
         - "4" + "5" = "45" (String concatenation)
         - obj1 + obj2 (Operator overloading in classes)
    -->

    <!-- Structure of a class in OOP: -->
    <!-- class ClassName -->
    <!-- { -->
    <!--     var;    // Data members -->
    <!--     function;  // Member functions -->
    <!-- } -->

    <!-- Example of creating objects from a class: -->
    <!-- const xyz = new ClassName(); // Create an instance of ClassName called xyz -->
    <!-- const xyz1 = new ClassName(); // Create another instance called xyz1 -->
    <!-- Accessing members: -->
    <!-- xyz.var; // Access a data member of the class through the object -->
    <!-- xyz.function(); // Call a member function of the class through the object -->
