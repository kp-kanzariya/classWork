    Variables/Identifiers: Used to store values.
    
    Ways to declare variables:
    1. `var`: Global scope (can be redeclared and updated)
    2. `let`: Block scope (cannot be redeclared in the same scope, but can be updated)
    3. `const`: Block scope (cannot be redeclared or updated, must be initialized when declared)

    Scopes:
    1. Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function, accessible from anywhere in the code.
    2. Local Scope: Variables declared within a function, accessible only within that function.
    3. Block Scope: Variables declared within a block (e.g., inside curly braces `{}`), accessible only within that block.
    4. Functional Scope: Variables declared inside a function, accessible only within that function.
    5. Variable Scope: Refers to the scope in which the variable is available.

    JavaScript is a loosely typed language: You don't need to specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. The type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned.
    
    Example variable declarations:
    var/let/const var123Name = value; 
    -->

    <script>
        // Using `var` (Global scope)
        /*
        var x = 1; // Variable `x` is assigned an integer value
        var x = 23.56; // `x` is redeclared and assigned a float value
        x = "VAR"; // `x` is reassigned a string value
        document.write(x); // Output: VAR
        */

        // Using `let` (Block scope)
        /*
        let x = 1; // Variable `x` is assigned an integer value
        // let x = 23.56; // Uncommenting this will cause an error because `let` cannot be redeclared in the same block
        x = "LET"; // `x` is reassigned a string value
        document.write(x); // Output: LET
        */

        // Using `const` (Block scope)
        const x = 1; // Variable `x` is assigned an integer value
        // const x = 23.56; // Uncommenting this will cause an error because `const` cannot be redeclared or reassigned
        // x = "LET"; // Uncommenting this will also cause an error because `const` cannot be reassigned
        document.write(x); // Output: 1 (since `const` cannot be changed after initialization)
    </script>
