CSS Breakdown

    #test::before
        This selector targets the ::before pseudo-element of the element with the ID test. The ::before pseudo-element is used to insert content before the actual content of the element.

    content: "Ashish";
        Sets the initial content of the ::before pseudo-element to "Ashish". This text will appear before the content of the <h1> element.

    #test:hover::before
        This selector targets the ::before pseudo-element of the #test element when it is hovered over.

    content: "Nitin";
        Changes the content of the ::before pseudo-element to "Nitin" when the <h1> element is hovered.
            
            Additional Tips

    Text Styling:
        You can add more styles to the ::before pseudo-element to enhance the visual effect, such as changing color, font-size, or adding a border.

    Content Positioning:
        Adjust the position of the ::before pseudo-element using properties like position, margin, or padding if needed.

    Browser Testing:
        Ensure that your CSS works consistently across different browsers by testing the page in various environments.

    Accessibility:
        Consider adding ARIA attributes if you use ::before or ::after for significant content changes to ensure screen readers can interpret the changes.-->
